    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Mulei Ma received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from the Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China, in 2020. Received the master’s degree with the School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. He is currently pursuing PhD degree in IoT Thrust and Research Center for Digital World with Intelligent Things (DOIT), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Guangzhou, China, supervised by Prof. Yang Yang.</p>
    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>My research spans several emerging areas in edge intelligence, federated learning, and network optimization, with a focus on improving the efficiency, performance, and user experience of large-scale systems and networks. The main themes of my work are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LLM Collaboration Scheduling:</strong> Focused on multi-tier scheduling of large language models for collaborative AI computing. This includes enhancing the interaction and scheduling efficiency of models across heterogeneous edge networks. This research has been recognized by INFOCOM'25.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Localization and User Experience:</strong> Developing localized service systems to enhance user experience, and proposing models for multi-dimensional user experience in IoT systems. This work is presented at ICDCS'24 and APCC'24.</li>
        <li><strong>Federated Learning Systems:</strong> Researching on federated learning systems, focusing on optimizing data heterogeneity and improving energy efficiency in industrial deployments. Significant contributions include the development of FlocOff (accepted at JSAC'24) and Green HERO (IoTM'24).</li>
        <li><strong>Edge Network Optimization:</strong> Investigating multi-task offloading theory and network architecture evolution, including the optimization of CPU-GPU heterogeneous networks and the design of 6G AI architectures. These works have been presented at ICC'24, IoTJ'22, and NET'23.</li>
    </ul>
